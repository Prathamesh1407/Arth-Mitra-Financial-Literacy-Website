            <p>
              In India, taxes are levied on income, wealth, and property. Income tax is levied on individual incomes, while the central government levies corporate taxes. The wealth tax is levied on the net value of assets owned by individuals or companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The revenue generated from these taxes is vital for the smooth functioning of the country, as the government needs these funds to foster economic growth and development. The tax varies with the respective income as per the tax slab in India.

        <h1>List of Tax-Saving Options for Different Sections</h1>
        <h2>1. Under 80C</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">ðŸŽ¯ Equity Linked Savings Scheme 
          It is a type of mutual fund with a lock-in period of 3 years. It is the only category of mutual fund in India that qualifies for a tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
          Returns provided by ELSS are comparatively higher than other tax-saving schemes in the long run, as the investments are primarily made in equity markets. Investment can either be made in a lump sum or SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) method. However, you cannot withdraw your money before the completion of the three-year lock-in period.
          A significant point to take note of here is the risk factor. Since the investments are made in the stock market, they could carry a relatively high risk. But if you remain consistent, it can prove to be a great option in the long run.
